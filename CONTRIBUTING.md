# Contributing to RiNBP

Thank you for participating in the Distributed and Non-Relational Databases course. This guide explains how to update your project information or add a new project to the STUDENT-PROJECTS.md file.

## Updating Your Project Details

The STUDENT-PROJECTS.md file contains a table with all student projects. To update your project's title, description, or other details:

### Option 1: Pull Request

1. Fork the repository
2. Edit the STUDENT-PROJECTS.md file
3. Find your project row in the table
4. Update the relevant cells (project title, description, etc.)
5. Commit your changes with a descriptive message
6. Submit a pull request

### Option 2: Issue Creation

If you're not comfortable with the pull request process:

1. Go to the repository's "Issues" tab
2. Click "New Issue"
3. Select the "Update Project Information" template
4. Fill in all the relevant information in the template
5. Submit the issue

The template will guide you through providing all necessary information for updating your project details.

## Adding a New Project

To add a new project to the STUDENT-PROJECTS.md table:

### Option 1: Pull Request

1. Fork the repository
2. Edit the STUDENT-PROJECTS.md file
3. Add a new row to the table with your project information:
   - Next available number
   - Project title with link to project folder (if already created)
   - Project description
   - Mark appropriate columns (SQL, NoSQL, CNA - Complex Network Analysis) with âœ“ based on technologies used
   - Your name
   - GitHub repository link (if available)
4. Commit your changes with a descriptive message
5. Submit a pull request

### Option 2: Issue Creation

1. Go to the repository's "Issues" tab
2. Click "New Issue"
3. Select the "New Project Proposal" template
4. Fill in all the required information in the template
5. Submit the issue

The template will guide you through providing all necessary information for your new project proposal.

### Project Ideas

You can either:
- Choose from the existing ideas in [PROJECT-IDEAS.md](PROJECT-IDEAS.md)
- Propose your original project idea that aligns with course objectives

All projects should involve database technologies covered in the course and represent a meaningful application of distributed or non-relational database concepts.

## Repository Link Updates

If you need to update your GitHub repository link:

1. Make sure your repository is public and properly named
2. Follow either Option 1 or Option 2 above
3. If using Option 2, specify the new repository URL in your issue

## Project Requirements

Remember that your project should:

- Match the approved project idea
- Implement the database technologies specified in your proposal
- Include appropriate documentation
- Have a public GitHub repository with regular commits

## Questions or Help

If you have questions about updating your project information or need help with the process, please contact the course instructor.
