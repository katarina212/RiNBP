| 12 | [System for Detection and Classification of Network Threats](projects/jadric) | This project aims to build an system for detecting and classifying network threats by analyzing network traffic patterns, identifying anomalies, and predicting potential attacks. Through the integration of graph-based network analysis, this system will be able to recognize suspicious connections that may indicate malicious activities such as DDoS attacks, phishing attempts, or malware propagation. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | Mia Jadrić | [GitHub](https://github.com/mjadric/rinbp25-Network-Threat-Detection-System) |
| 13 | [Aviation Accident Network Analysis](projects/kujundzic) | This project will implement and compare SQL and NoSQL database approaches for analyzing aviation accident data as a network, examining relationships between locations, causes, aircraft types, and survival rates. The performance and suitability of both database types will be evaluated through various network analysis techniques including centrality measures, cluster detection, and temporal trend analysis to determine which database paradigm better serves different analytical needs in the aviation safety domain. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | Nediljka Kujundžić | [GitHub](https://github.com/nkujundzic1010/rinbp25-aviation-accident) |
| 14 | [Transfermarkt - Player transfer management](projects/juric) | This project will implement a system that enables tracking, management and analysis of football player transfers between clubs using non-relational database (NoSQL) for flexibility and scalability to handle complex relationships and large datasets. Data will be stored on players, transfers, clubs, market values ​​and others. The system will solve the problem of data consistency in the face of frequent transfers and changes in player values. |  | ✓ |  | Tomislav Jurič | [GitHub](https://github.com/tomisljuric/rinbp25-transfermarkt) |
