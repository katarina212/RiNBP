### DuckDB Integration (Improved Integration, not just Appendix)
- Comparing DuckDB procedures and functions with traditional RDBMS
- When to use embedded analytics vs. server-based SQL programming
- Migration path from traditional stored procedures to DuckDB analytics
- Hybrid architectures with OLTP databases and DuckDB

## 3. Practical Examples Enhancements

### Real-world Case Studies
- Add more realistic business examples for procedures and triggers
- Include examples from different industries (finance, e-commerce, healthcare)
- Show complete solutions, not just code snippets
- Include before/after performance metrics

### Interactive Elements
- Incorporate SQL Fiddle or DB Fiddle examples
- Provide links to GitHub repositories with complete examples
- Add QR codes to online SQL environments for students to try examples

### Modern Use Cases
- Add ETL/ELT procedures for data warehousing
- Implement audit logging with triggers
- Create a simple recommendation system using stored procedures
- Implement role-based access control with functions and procedures

## 4. Visual Improvements

### Diagrams and Flow Charts
- Add visual representation of trigger execution flow
- Include workflow diagrams for stored procedure execution
- Add entity-relationship diagrams for example databases
- Include execution plan visualizations

### Comparison Tables
- Expand comparison between different RDBMS procedural languages
- Add feature support matrix for different database systems
- Include performance comparison tables for various approaches

## 5. Modern Development Practices

### DevOps for Database Code
- Version control for stored procedures and functions
- CI/CD pipelines for database code
- Testing frameworks for SQL code
- Automated deployment of SQL programs

### Security Best Practices
- SQL injection prevention in dynamic SQL
- Privilege management for stored procedures
- Security auditing with triggers

## 6. Integration with Data Science

### SQL for Analytics
- Strengthen connection between DuckDB and data science workflows
- Demonstrate integration with Python/R for data analysis
- Show example of predictive model deployment as a stored procedure
- Explore SQL extensions for machine learning (e.g., MADlib, SQL Server ML Services)

## 7. Hands-on Exercises

### Practical Assignments
- Add more guided exercises for students to implement
- Include challenging problem-solving scenarios
- Provide template code and expected outcomes
- Create multi-step projects that build throughout the lecture

## 8. Additional Resources

### Extended Bibliography
- Add recommended books, articles, and online resources
- Include links to advanced tutorials and documentation
- Reference academic papers on SQL programming performance

### Industry Standards and Best Practices
- Include references to industry standard practices
- Add links to style guides for SQL programming
- Reference database vendor recommendations

## Implementation Priority

1. Expand modern SQL features section (high priority)
2. Add real-world case studies (high priority)
3. Improve integration with DuckDB rather than separate appendix (medium priority)
4. Add DevOps for database code section (medium priority)
5. Create visual diagrams to illustrate concepts (medium priority)
6. Develop hands-on exercises (medium priority)
7. Integrate data science connections (lower priority)
8. Update formatting and layout (lower priority)
