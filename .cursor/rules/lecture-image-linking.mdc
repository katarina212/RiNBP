# Rule: Lecture Image Linking Best Practices

## Description
This rule provides guidelines for effectively linking and using generated images within Marp-based lecture slides, ensuring consistency, proper sizing, and optimal display.

## Implementation Details

### Basic Image Linking
- Use relative paths from the lecture markdown file to the images folder
- Always include images in their own slides or with sufficient space
- Use width/height controls for consistent sizing across slides
- Example:
  ```markdown
  ## Slide Title

  ![width:800px](mdc:images/image_name.png)
  ```

### Image Sizing Guidelines
- Use consistent image sizes throughout a presentation
- For full-width images: `![width:800px](mdc:images/image_name.png)`
- For half-width images: `![width:400px](mdc:images/image_name.png)`
- For side-by-side images:
  ```markdown
  <div class="columns">
  <div>

  ![width:380px](mdc:images/left_image.png)

  </div>
  <div>

  ![width:380px](mdc:images/right_image.png)

  </div>
  </div>
  ```

### Background Images and Right Alignment
- Background images in Marp provide a powerful way to position images alongside content
- **Right-aligning images** is particularly useful for presentations with text on left, visuals on right
- Use the `bg right` directive with optional percentage to control width:

#### Basic Right Alignment
```markdown
![bg right](mdc:assets/image_name.png)
```
- This positions the image on the right side, taking up 50% of the slide width by default

#### Controlling Width of Right-Aligned Image
```markdown
![bg right:40%](mdc:assets/image_name.png)
```
- This sets the image to take up 40% of the slide width on the right side
- Adjust percentage to fine-tune the layout (30-40% often works well for QR codes)

#### Right Alignment with Image Sizing
```markdown
![bg right:35% width:400px](mdc:assets/image_name.png)
```
- Combines right alignment with explicit width control
- Useful for ensuring consistent image sizes across slides while maintaining right alignment

#### Using Right-Aligned Images with Content
```markdown
![bg right:40%](mdc:assets/qr_code.png)

# Main Title or Link

Additional content goes here on the left side
```
- Content will automatically flow in the space not occupied by the image
- Great for pairing explanatory text with diagrams or QR codes with links

#### Tips for Right-Aligned Images
- Keep text minimal when using right-aligned images to avoid crowding
- Ensure sufficient contrast between background and text
- For QR codes, test scanning functionality at presentation resolution
- Consider using `<!-- _class: center -->` directive to vertically center content

- Left-aligned background: `![bg left:40%](mdc:images/image_name.png)`
- Full background with opacity: `![bg brightness:0.6](mdc:images/image_name.png)`
- Multiple background images:
  ```markdown
  ![bg right:33%](mdc:images/image1.png)
  ![bg right:33%](mdc:images/image2.png)
  ![bg right:33%](mdc:images/image3.png)
  ```

### Image Captions and References
- Include captions below important figures
- Credit image sources when using external images
- Example:
  ```markdown
  ![width:700px](mdc:images/network_analysis.png)

  *Figure 1: Network analysis of social connections. Source: Example Dataset (2023)*
  ```

### Image-Code Pairing
- When showing code examples related to images, pair them closely
- Split the slide between code and image when appropriate
- Example:
  ```markdown
  <div class="columns">
  <div>

  ```python
  import networkx as nx
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  
  G = nx.karate_club_graph()
  nx.draw(G, with_labels=True)
  plt.show()
  ```

  </div>
  <div>

  ![width:380px](mdc:images/karate_club.png)

  </div>
  </div>
  ```

### Progressive Image Reveals
- For step-by-step demonstrations, use multiple slides with progressive images
- Name images sequentially: `step1.png`, `step2.png`, etc.
- Keep consistent positioning and sizing between steps
- Example:
  ```markdown
  ## Step 1: Initial Network

  ![width:700px](mdc:images/algorithm_step1.png)

  ---

  ## Step 2: Node Removal

  ![width:700px](mdc:images/algorithm_step2.png)
  ```

### Technical Considerations
- Ensure all image files exist before presenting
- Optimize image file sizes for quick loading (PNG for diagrams, JPG for photos)
- Verify that images are readable at presentation resolution
- Consider creating dark/light versions of diagrams if presenting in different lighting conditions

### Backup Strategies
- Include textual descriptions for critical visualizations
- Prepare alternative explanations for cases where images cannot be displayed
- Consider providing links to high-resolution versions of complex diagrams

## Benefits
- Consistent visual experience throughout the presentation
- Better readability and comprehension of visual content
- Effective pairing of code examples with their visual outputs
- Optimized slide layout for presentation on different screen sizes
- Professional appearance with proper image formatting and attribution
