# Database Course Project Ideas

## Introduction

This document contains project ideas for students taking the "Selected Topics in Relational and Non-Relational Databases" course. These projects are designed to provide hands-on experience with various database technologies and concepts covered throughout the lectures. Students are encouraged to select a project that aligns with their interests and career goals, or propose their own ideas for approval.

Each project should demonstrate understanding of database design principles, implementation skills, and the ability to solve real-world data management challenges. Projects can be completed individually or in small teams, depending on complexity and scope.
